# Data Interview Questions: Problem #4

# Question 4 - Active users on a messaging application
# Below is a table schema for a P2P messaging application. The table contains send/receive message data for the 
# application's users, and has the following schema:
# 
# time_stamp                    sender_id                       receiver_id
# (#timestamp, epoch seconds)   (# id of the message sender)	  (# id of the message receiver)
# 
# Question: What fraction of active users communicated with at least 15 unique people on March 1, 2018? You should 
# be able to write complete code to answer this, given just the schema above.
